Thank you for visiting my Subprime mortgage stock price analysis repository!

The major goal of this project is to use Python to analyze substantial changes in the stock prices of major American banks.

Initially, this project was done in Jupyter, but I transferred all of my code to Github with more potentially understandable comments.

This project is centered around year 2008 when Subprime mortgage crisis hit the USA although there are some examples from 2015 in the code. (You can switch them to 2008 if you want!) 

Mostly, this project contains graphical analysis. (i.e clustermap and heatmap)

For instance, this project contains: Seaborn: distplots and pairplots, Matplotlib, cufflinks: interactive clustermap, candle plots, simple moving averages, bollinger plot.

Simultaneously, this project has a Pandas dataframe data manipulation component. (i.e finding maximum, minumum return values, and standard deviation values)

There are some technical analysis parts too. (simple moving average (sma), Bollinger Band plot, candle plot)

I added some comments to my code. Please, feel free to pull my code and change it to something that interests you. 

Please, notice that there are required dependencies: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Cufflinks, and Plotly.

To install these libraries, please, visit their corresponding websites after you simply Google them. 

I assure that the installation process is very simple. 

Only to simply explain what is inside my repository, 03-Finance Project.py has all my code. 

And all_banks is a file that Python can read. 

This file contains the stock data of major American companies from 2006 Jan 1st to 2016 Jan 1st.

Unfortunately, when I imported some data from Yahoo, some of the extracted data from it for Citi Group did not seem to be right. 

So I used Google Finance for analyzing some of the major American banks during Subprime mortgage crisis. 

I really hope that this code can help and interest someone like you to learn more about data representation in Python. 

If you have any questions/concerns, please, feel free to reach out to me via email. (You can acquire my email address on Github)

Thank you very much for reading this!
